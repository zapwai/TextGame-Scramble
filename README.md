# TextGame-Scramble
Unscramble the word!
---
Run scramble from the terminal.

There are three modes of play.

In basic mode you unscramble random 5 letter words. If you guess incorrectly 3 times, the game ends.

In moderate they are 6 letter words, but you only have 30 seconds until the game ends.

In hard the length of words increases, along with your clock time. But one wrong answer and game over!
